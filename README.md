# Pipelined SIMD multimedia unit Design with the VHDL/Verilog

## Prokect Description
This project focuses on the structural and behavioral design of a four-stage pipelined Multimedia Unit (MMU). The design is implemented using VHDL, a hardware description language, to model the MMU with a reduced subset of multimedia instructions, similar to those in Sony Cell SPU and Intel SSE architectures.

The complete 4-stage pipelines is designed at the register transfer level (RTL) developed in a structural manner with several modules operating simultaneously. Each module or entity is developed behaviorally and verified individually with their respective self-checking test benches. This will ensure the functional correctness of all ALU operation prior to full system integration of the 4-stage MMU. The complete top-level MMU model is then instantiated with another test bench to validate the completeness of the four-stage pipeline, where each instruction will cycle through all stages of the pipeline. The resulting outputs will demonstrate the operational behavior and status of each pipeline stage during execution.

## Overview
This is Part I of two part, focusing exclusively on the architecture
of the Multimedia ALU during the execution stage. At this phase, no prior knowledge
of the complete pipeline design is required for implementing the Multimedia ALU module.
The ALU is assumed to have received all the correct and necessary input signals as provided
through the complete pipeline up to the stage following the forwarding unit.
A behavioral model approach will be employed to design the test bench for the Multimedia
ALU. With this approach, the expected results for each test case are predetermined to facil-
itate the self-checking aspect of the test bench design. The direct comparison between the
ALUâ€™s computed outputs and the expected result ensure accurate functional verification for
the instruction sets.
